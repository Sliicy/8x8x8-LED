This directory has 2 folders, each corresponding to different types of cubes.
The Monochrome folder contains firmware for flashing a cube that only has 1 color.
The RGB folder on the other hand is intended for cubes that have RGB.

In the RGB folder, there is both the original firmware which shipped with the cube, as well as the Arduino project I used to control the cube from USB Serial. The firmware can either be flashed using Arduino, or with the STM32 Cube Programmer.
